            Our ArmA 3 server
        </h2>
        <p>
            go2tech.de provides a server which is mainly used to fulfill our own needs when playing ArmA 3 when it comes to mods, missions and scripts.
            That means that our server may change the active mission at any time, as well as being locked when we want to have a <i>private</i> round.<br>
            <br>
            However, apart from that, the server is <strong>publicly</strong> available and <strong>everyone is very welcome to join</strong> and play on it!<br>
            <br>
            Currently we mostly host the Co10 Escape from Altis mission.
