We're proudly providing our services to our community (which we're a part of).
It's also our philosophy, that our players should be able to focus on having a great time on our server.

### How to donate

However, if you considered donating any amount of money in order to keep the servers running, or just as an appreciation to our efforts, we're providing a way for you to donate via PayPal.

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
    <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" />
    <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="84T3PXQ2GYHFS" />
    <input type="image" src="/assets/img/paypal-donate-button.png" border="0" name="submit" title="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" alt="Donate with PayPal button" />

### What you get with your donation

We **DO NOT** offer any perks or benefits for our donators, at least apart from our commitment to provide an awesome experience on our services.
This also complies with the nature of a donation, as well as with our philosophy and the Bohemia Interactive monetization guidelines.
